title: 'How to Cook Pancit Canton',
content: `Here is a summary of what I did to achieve this delicious and tasty pancit canton.

I started by preparing the vegetables. Blanch the snap peas, carrot, and cabbage. Blanching is a cooking method that retains the texture and color of vegetables. Do this by first preparing a large bowl that can accomodate all the vegetables. Fill half of it with cold water and add ice. Set the bowl aside. Meanwhile boil water on a cooking pot and put all the veggies in there. Boil for less than a minute (around 50 seconds) and then transfer the veggies to the bowl with ice water. The temperature of the water stops the vegetable from cooking further.This helps make the veggies crisp and retain its color. Set the vegetables aside. These will be added back towards the end of the process.

Saute onion and garlic until soft. Add the meat and continue to cook until the color turns light brown. You can add seasonings and chicken broth. Let boil and continue to cook with the pot covered until the meats are tender.

The shrimp and chopped parsley goes next. These cooks quickly. Add the noodles afterwards and cover the pot. Let the noodles absorb the steam. This makes it softer. Toss the noodles and continue to cook until the liquid is completely absorbed. You may want to add more water if the noodles seem dry.

Finish it by adding back the blanched vegetables and seasoning with ground black pepper. Toss until all ingredients are well distributed.`,

{
title: 'Alternative Ingredients for Pancit Canton',
content: `There are many ways to cook pancit canton. The difference between each version has something to do with the main ingredients used.

You can use snow peas a a substitute for snap peas. These are called chicharo in Filipino.

• Chicken can also be a good alternative to pork.
• The oyster sauce is an optional ingredient. I like it because it improves the flavor of pancit canton.
• Sliced long green beans can be added to the dish.
• Napa cabbage can be used as an alternative ingredient to regular cabbage.`,

title: 'Pancit Canton Versions',
content: `Vegetarian – This version is vegetarian and vegan friendly. It had the basic ingredients with the addition of Shiitake mushroom. This is a flavorful mushroom variety that I used most of the time when cooking Asian dishes.

Instant – There was a time when instant pancit canton was a staple because of its price and ease of preparation. However, this is not the healthiest food that you can make for yourself or your family. I developed this recipe to introduce a healthier instant pancit canton by adding vegetables.

Shrimp – I like to have shrimp in my doodle dish. It provides a good flavor and is always pleasant to eat. This particular version makes use of frozen shrimp along with bell peppers. It is one of my go to recipe when I feel like making a quick one with limited time.

Shrimp and Chicken – A combination of shrimp and chicken for a noodle dish is always a good idea. This recipe has shredded chicken and pan-fried shrimp. I also had some Chinese sausage in it to lift the overall flavor to the next level.

Squid Ball – Chow mein with squid ball is a budget-friendly dish. It is composed of the same flour noodles with vegetables such as cabbage and carrots. A popular Filipino street food known as squid balls are utilized. A squid ball is a ball-shaped mixture with either fresh chopped squid or squid flavor.

Seafood – One of my favorite version is seafood. It has shrimp, squid, crabmeat, squiballs, and mushroom. I think that this is one of the tastiest noodle dish that I made. It is perfect during lent when Catholics are abstaining from meat.

Saucy – Pancit canton with extra sauce is always good to have. There are even times when I eat it with rice. It might sound unusual, but the flavorful sauce always complement whatever dish or side dish you eat it with. I like mine with more calamansi, so I squeeze a piece of it over the pancit before eating.

Pancit Canton and Bihon – another version of pancit canton that is famous in Cebu and its nearby provinces is called Bam-I. It is a combination of both flour sticks and rice stick noodles. Any topping ingredient can be used to make this version. The key here to be able to cook both noodles properly and distribute it evenly to make the dish look good.`,
},
{
title: 'What is the Best Condiment for Pancit Canton?',
content: `The best condiment for pancit canton for me is a mixture composed of soy sauce and calamansi. It is also known as “toyomansi”.

Calamansi or calamondin is a citrus fruit. It is smaller than lime and has a sour and a bit bitter taste. Lemon and lime can also be used a substitutes when calamansi is not available.

Simply pour a tablespoons or two of toyomansi on your noodle dish and toss until well blended. Yummy!`,

{
title: 'What is a Pancit Palabok',
content: `Pancit Palabok is a variation of pancit, a classic dish many Filipinos enjoy. Despite the many different kinds of pancit in the country, palabok is easily recognized by certain trademark characteristics: its thin noodles and orange sauce in particular. Some say that one synonym of palabok is “salsa na malapot” –– meaning, a sauce that is gooey and viscous in nature.

However, the orange color of palabok’s sauce doesn’t come from the orange fruit; instead, palabok sauce is usually a combination of pork broth, shrimp cubes, ground pork, and annatto powder. The latter is the reason behind these noodles’ bright and refreshing appearance.

Aside from its appearance, what sets pancit palabok apart from other popular pancit variations? Let’s find out.`,
},
{
title: 'What is the difference between Pancit Malabon and Palabok?',
content: `Tasty and true to its name, Pancit Malabon hails from –– you guessed it –– the city of Malabon! Its bright appearance bears a resemblance to that of Pancit Palabok; the use of hard boiled eggs, chicharon, and shrimp, too, cannot be discounted. Many people consider Pancit Palabok and Pancit Malabon to be one and the same because of this.

However, one of the biggest differences lies in the type of noodles we use in each kind of pancit. In Pancit Palabok, the noodles are much thinner. The typical noodle of choice is bihon, which are almost clear in nature and known for their narrowness. Meanwhile, Malabon’s noodles are considerably thicker.

Another difference is the toppings. Pancit Malabon tends to use more seafood, like shrimp, squid –– even oysters at times! While palabok has shrimps, too, that’s typically as far as seafood toppings go for this kind of pancit. When serving palabok, one usually only puts the toppings and sauce atop the noodles instead of mixing them. With Pancit Malabon, on the other hand, the ingredients, toppings, and sauce are more incorporated.`,
},
{
title: 'What makes Pancit Malabon different from Pancit Luglug?',
content: `Essentially, Pancit Luglug is just the Kapampangan version of Pancit Palabok. From the toppings all the way down to its special sauce, Luglug looks even more similar to Palabok than Pancia Malabon does.

However, the difference, once again, is in the noodles! Luglug is actually a term that refers specifically to the method of cooking thick rice noodles. While some say that you can make pancit luglug with both thick or thin noodles, it is more common to use the former rather than the latter.`,
},
{
title: 'How to Cook Pancit Palabok',
content: `Making Pancit Palabok is usually divided into two portions: making the sauce and making the toppings. Altogether, cooking and prep time shouldn’t take longer than 45 minutes! In no time at all, you’ll have enough Pancit Palabok to feed your whole family. 

Your sauce ingredients don’t require a lot of preparation beforehand, but your toppings sure do. Boil 1 cup of pork, then thinly slice and cut it into small pieces. Cube 2 pieces of fried firm tofu, pound half a cup of chicharon, and slice 2 hard boiled eggs. Don’t forget to boil or steam your shrimp (about half a cup) then finely chop your green onions or scallions.

All ready? Let’s start cooking! Soak 1 pack of rice noodles in water for about 15 minutes. Afterwards, drain them and set it aside. We’ll be focusing on the sauce portion of your pancit palabok first; begin by heating some cooking oil in a saucepan. Once your oil is hot enough, pour in half a pound of ground pork, letting it cook for about 5 to 7 minutes. 

Take your tablespoon of annatto powder and dilute it in 3 cups of pork broth. If you’re using annatto seeds, it’s important to soak them first in 3 tablespoons of water to bring out the palabok’s trademark color. Pour this mixture into a saucepan and bring it to a boil. Add your shrimp cube and stir, letting the sauce simmer for about 3 minutes. Little by little, pour in, too, your 6 tablespoons of all purpose flour. Stir your pancit palabok sauce gradually as you do so. Add 2 tablespoons of fish sauce and half a teaspoon of ground black pepper and let your sauce simmer until it becomes thick. Once it has, turn the heat off and set it aside. 

With your sauce out of the way, let’s now prepare the rest of your pancit! Boil enough water in a pot. Then, take your noodles and put them in a strainer (metal or bamboo), then submerge said strainer in the boiling water. This should only take about a minute or so, until the noodles are cooked. Remove the strainer from the pot, and drain the remaining water.

Now it’s time to prepare your pancit palabok serving plate! Place the noodles first before pouring the sauce over them thoroughly. Arrange your toppings –- your tofu, your chicharon, your shrimp, eggs, and others –– around the plate, and over the sauce. Last but not the least, give your pancit palabok that zesty flavor with a slice of lemon or calamansi.`,

{
title: `How to Cook Sisig`,
content: `Start to cook sisig by boiling the meat. I boiled the pork belly and maskara for 1 hour in medium heat. The meat needs to be tenderized so that it will be easier to chop later on.

I also grill the meat after boiling. This will give it a good texture. There are no marinades or rubs needed here. Simply put the boiled pork belly and maskara on a hot grill, and then grill each side for 5 minutes or until is starts to darken.

It is chopping time at this point. Simply chop the belly and pig face into small pieces. I use a knife known as a cleaver to assist me in this step. It weighs heavy enough and has a sharp cutting edge that helps me chop easily. The size of the chopped pork will depend on your preference. You can go a bit bigger or chop it as fine as it can get depending on your preference. Set the meat aside after this step. It is time to cook it on the stovetop.

I started by sautéing the onions. Chicken livers were added afterwards. These steps can be interchanged just so you know. Let me explain. Chicken liver is an essential ingredient for my sisig recipes. It provides a good amount of flavor to the dish. These can be chopped or sliced into smaller pieces before cooking. I am just not used in doing that, but you can. What I do is to cook it thoroughly and mash it right on the pan while cooking. These livers are easier to mash when thoroughly cooked, unlike pork or beef liver, which tend to get tougher. You can fry the chicken liver first until cooked all throughout. This will usually take 5 minutes. The other option is to do it as this recipe suggest. An easier option for beginners would be to chop the livers into small pieces before cooking. This makes mashing it easier.

Add the chopped pork into the mix. These do not need to cook long. Give it a nice stir for around 3 minutes just to ensure that all ingredients in the pan are distributed evenly. Add seasonings and spices afterwards. You have the option to add chili flakes at this point. Note that I am using Knorr Liquid Seasoning to provide additional flavor to the dish. It can provide a good amount of flavor compared to regular soy sauce.

The final texture of sisig is somewhat mushy. Pig brains are added into the mixture in traditional recipes to obtain this. Good news! There are alternative ingredients. Mayonnaise is one. This is what I used in this recipe.

A good way to present sisig is to put it on a metal plate and serve while sizzling. This makes the dish more appetizing to the eye. This is optional.`,
},
{
title: `Alternative Ingredients`,
content: `Pig face and ears are the traditional ingredients for sisig. This recipe is using an alternative ingredient in the form of pork belly. Pork shoulders can also be used in this recipe.

Chicken sisig is a good version that can be made using this recipe. Substitute chopped chicken thighs for the pork. Make sure that the chicken was boiled the same way before chopping it.

Fish sisig and tofu sisig are versions of the dish that are done differently. These can be good alternative dishes for non-pork eaters.`,

title: `What is Chicken Adobo`,
content: `A dish and cooking process native to the Philippines, adobo refers to the method of marinating meat, seafood, or vegetables (pretty much anything!) in a combination of soy sauce and vinegar. This marinade also includes other herbs and flavorings like garlic, bay leaves, and whole peppercorns.

Cooking food in vinegar is no foreign concept to us Filipinos. In pre-colonial times, our ancestors used to cook seafood in vinegar in order to preserve their freshness. Many regard adobo as a spin on kinilaw, which is another traditional cooking method. Kinilaw refers mainly to cooking raw seafood in vinegar and spices. Another similar process is paksiw, which utilizes meat broth in vinegar and spices.

What really sets adobo apart is the presence of soy sauce in its marinade. While vinegar has a pungent aroma and a very distinctly sour taste, soy sauce is on both the sweeter and saltier side. A staple in any Asian household, soy sauce (or toyo) definitely helps in bringing out chicken adobo’s savory taste.

(Here’s a fun fact: did you know that there are different kinds of soy sauce? In Japan especially, there are five different kinds of soy sauce that each have their own unique flavors and uses. The most common one you’ll find in markets is dark soy sauce, or koikuchi. With a deeper color than most other types, dark soy sauce is packed with flavor –– perfect for your chicken adobo!)

Adobo also contains dry bay leaves in its recipe. Although you aren’t to eat them whole, bay leaves lend their subtle, deep flavors to this umami dish. It may not be the star of the show, but your chicken adobo wouldn’t be complete without it. However, you can choose to substitute this herb with basil if you can’t find it at stores.`,

{
title: `Chicken Adobo Origin`,
content: `The famous Chicken Adobo originated in the Philippines. The dish is prepared using the Inadobo style of cooking. It means cooking meat or seafood with vinegar and mostly soy sauce. It is a popular method during the olden days when refrigerators and freezers were not yet available because vinegar helps extend the shelf life of food. Another popular variation is pork adobo using pork belly.`,
},
{
title: `How to Cook Chicken Adobo`,
content: `Cooking Chicken Adobo is quick and simple. This recipe suggests marinating the chicken to make it more flavorful. It is the best way to go if you want to experience authentic Filipino chicken adobo. If you are in a hurry, feel free to skip this step, but make sure to simmer the chicken longer than 30 minutes to better extract the flavors from it.

Start by marinating the chicken in soy sauce and garlic. The garlic needs to be crushed for best results. This process takes 1 hour to 12 hours depending on how flavorful you want the dish to be. Sometimes marinating for an hour is not enough. I think that 3 hours is optimal. The chicken absorbs most of the flavors from the soy sauce and garlic during this step. It is noticeable when you taste the dish after cooking. Note that it is also possible to include the vinegar in this step.

The next step is to separate the chicken from the marinade. Make sure to set the marinade aside because it will be used later on. Pan-fry the chicken pieces for 1 to 1 ½ minutes per side. This will partially cook the outer part. It also makes the skin tough enough to withstand stewing later. This means that it will remain intact, which is nice for presentation.

Pour marinade into the pot and add water. Let boil. The bay leaves and whole peppercorn can now be added. The process takes 20 to 25 minutes depending on the quality of the chicken. However, feel free to cook longer in low heat for a super tender chicken adobo.

Add the vinegar. This can also be added as a part of the marinade. Let it cook for 10 minutes and then add sugar and salt. I only add salt if needed. It is important to taste your dish before adding seasonings.

Filipino chicken adobo can be served with or without sauce. If you like it very tasty then continue to cook on an uncovered cooking pot until the liquid completely evaporates.`,

This version of Filipino Adobo suggests marinating the pork in soy sauce and crushed garlic. By preference, vinegar can also be added as a marinade ingredient.

Mexican adobo, on the other hand, makes use of chillies, garlic, cinnamon, and oregano as marinade.

Both dishes look and taste different. It will be unfair to compare which among the two dishes are best because each of us has our own preference when it comes to flavor.`,

Whether you’re boiling, blanching, or steaming it, kangkong is really versatile, and enjoyable no matter how you cook it.

But you don’t just eat kangkong because it’s delicious; you eat it because it’s nutritious, too! Kangkong is a great source of several nutrients, including but not limited to Vitamin A, copper, calcium, and zinc.

title: `Lumpia Ingredients`,
content: `This deep fried lumpia recipe still tastes great even if I kept the ingredients at a minimum. The main protein for this version is ground pork. I also added carrot for additional sweetness and parsley to make it taste fresh.

It is important to ensure that the flavor of the lumpia filling is flavorful. I don’t want to rely on the dipping sauce most of the time. Salt, sesame oil, garlic powder, and ground black pepper are simple ingredients that provide great results in terms of flavor.

The lumpia wrapper used in this recipe is store-bought. I will talk more about it later. By the way, eggs are used when making the lumpia filling in order to bind all the ingredients together. It prevents the meat mixture from falling apart or separate from each other when frying.`,
},
{
title: `How to Cook Lumpia`,
content: `The procedure in cooking lumpia is simple. First is to combine all the filling ingredients in a bowl, and them mix altogether until well blended. The next step is to wrap the lumpia mixture in egg roll wrapper. I showed how I did it in the video below. The final step is to deep-fry it until brown and crispy.

Let’s talk about the first step. You can simply add all the ingredients in a bowl and mix thoroughly. It can be done the manual way using your hands. An easier way is to use a stand mixer. Make sure to attach the dough hook when going this route.

This is a basic recipe. It will give you a good tasting lumpia. However, you can play around with it by adding more ingredients to bring it up to the next level. A good example is the addition of seasonings to bring-in more flavors. Another good suggestion is to add a bit of Italian sausage to the mixture. You can also try adding veggies such as celery.

Wrapping lumpia is easy. It is something that you can get used to after a few tries. The tricky part in this process is when using a wide wrapper. The video below shows my technique on how to wrap lumpia using wide egg roll wrappers. It is quick and easy. You should try it for yourself.

Deep frying the lumpia has a little trick in order to ensure that the filling gets completely cooked while not getting the wrapper burnt. It has something to do with temperature. Make sure that you do not fry the lumpia on very hot oil. This will quickly brown the wrapper while leaving the meat mixture still under cooked. Try to fry the lumpia while the oil is starting to get hot, around 250 F. Let it slowly cook the inside. The wrapper will gradually brown as it fries. You will know that it is ready when it floats. By the way, I am assuming that you will follow my lead by also deep frying the egg rolls.

When it comes to the dipping sauce, I love to dip mine in sweet and sour sauce. Banana sauce or banana ketchup works too.`,
},
{
title: `Cooking Lumpia in an Air Fryer`,
content: `Using an air fryer is also a good way to cook lumpia without using oil. In fact, it is a healthier option. I usually set the temperature to 370F and air fry my lumpia for 12 minutes. The cooking time can be extended depending on how well you want your food done.

The oil from the ground pork also gets extracted during the cooking process. You will end up with less oil crispy lumpia to munch on.

When using an air frying to cook my lumpia, I usually spray a small amount of cooking oil on the wrapper. This makes it less dry. It depends on ones preference.`,

title: `Cooking Lumpia`,
content: `There are three major steps in making lumpia. The first is to make the meat mixture by combining and mixing all the filling ingredients. This involves ground pork, minced veggies, and seasonings. It can be done manually by hand or by the use of a tool such as a spatula, or mechanically using a stand mixer. It is important that all the ingredients are properly blended together to balance the flavor.

The next step involves wrapping the meat mixture in lumpia wrappers. These are thin sheets made from wheat flour. There are several ways to do this. Make sure to watch the video below to see how I wrapped the lumpia for this recipe. It is a good piece of information especially for newbies in cooking Filipino food.

The last and final step is to fry the lumpia. Deep-frying is recommended for best results. The Lumpiang Shanghai is simply fried until it turns golden brown.`,
},
{
title: `Alternative Ingredients`,
content: `Pork is the main protein used in making this dish. Ground chicken and fish flakes can also be utilized. Ground beef might work for some people, but it is something that I do not recommend.

Additional ingredients can also be added. I sometimes add minced singkamas to the meat mixture. Adding chopped green onions is also a good idea.

There are different kinds lumpia wrappers available in the market. The one used in this recipe are called spring roll wrappers. These are the ones traditionally used in the Philippines. Other thicker wrappers such as egg roll wrappers can also be used.`,
},
{
title: `Tips and Tricks`,
content: `The best lumpia are the ones that are crispy on the outside and cooked well in the inside. This means that the wrapper should be golden brown and crunchy and the meat mixture should be completely done.

It is important to be always aware of the temperature of oil while frying lumpia. Do not use high heat. It will quickly cook the wrapper while leaving the meat mixture inside incompletely cooked. I always recommend setting the heat between low to medium. It will cook the filling while the wrapper slowly gets browned.

Deep-frying the lumpia yields the best results. It ensures that all the sides of the spring rolls are cooked equal. It also saves you the effort of turning each piece over, compared when using lesser oil. This recommendation might not be ideal if you want to lessen your oil usage for budget reasons. It is up to you.

It is best to enjoy this with sweet and sour sauce. This classic recipe might be useful. Dipping lumpia in ketchup or in a mixture of soy sauce and calamansi works too.`,

The traditional recipe is composed of ox tail. There are instances wherein both ox tripe and tail are used. The vegetable components of the dish are string beans, eggplant, bok choy, and banana blossoms. Lightly browned toasted ground rice is used to thicken the sauce.

Palayok or clay pot is used to cook this dish. It also functions as the serving bowl at the same time.The best way to eat kare-kare is to pair it with plain white rice. Bagoong alamang or fermented shrimp paste completes the dish by providing flavor. Simply combine a spoonful of rice and kare-kare with a small portion of bagoong and enjoy!`,

{
title: `How to Cook Kare Kare`,
content: `There are three main processes: tenderize the meat, make the sauce, and prepare the vegetables.

Prepare the meat by boiling it along with chopped onion. This will make it tender while providing flavor at the same time. Oxtail needs to be very tender for best results. It takes around 3 hours to boil when cooking using the traditional method. A quicker way is to use a pressure cooker. It cuts the cooking time by more than half.

The peanut sauce can make or break your dish. It is important to have the proper ratio of ingredients to be able to achieve the ideal consistency of the sauce. It should not be too thick or very thin. I use both peanut butter and crushed peanuts to make the sauce. It provides a rich flavor to it. Annatto seeds make the color of the sauce reddish. You will need to extract the color from the seed by soaking it in warm water for around 12 minutes. The colored water is used to make the dish, not the seed. Discard the seed after use. Thicken the sauce with toasted ground rice.

Vegetable is an important component of kare kare. It can be cooked with the meat or it can be added when serving the dish. I opted to cook the vegetables separately by sautéing with garlic.`,
},
{
title: `Cooking Tips`,
content: `Use a pressure cooker to quickly tenderize the oxtail. It takes me 30 minutes to achieve the result, compared to around 3 hours when done the traditional way.

Make sure to monitor the amount of water when boiling using the traditional method. Pour more water as needed until the meat tenderizes completely.

Bagoong alamang or shrimp paste is an essential component of the dish. It should be cooked completely before serving. Refer to this bagoong recipe for guidance. You can also purchase precooked bottled bagoong alamang from the supermarket.`,

{
title: `Alternative Ingredients`,
content: `Toasted ground rice is traditionally used to thicken the sauce. This ingredient is nice to have. You can use cornstarch or potato starch as alternatives.

Annatto comes in many form. Annatto powder or annatto paste can be used a substitute for the seed. These are also more convenient to use.`,

description: `Sinigang is a sour soup native to the Philippines. This recipe uses pork as the main ingredient. Other proteins and seafood can also be used. Beef, shrimp, fish are commonly used to cook sinigang. The chicken version, on the other hand, is called sinampalukang manok. I prefer to use either pork belly or buto-buto when cooking sinigang. The latter refers to cuts with bones intact. These are either pork neck bones, chopped spare ribs, and chopped baby back ribs. Pork shoulder and ham can also be used when cooking sinigang.`,

title: `Souring Agents for Sinigang`,
content: `The quality of this dish depends on the souring agent. This is the ingredient that makes the soup sour. The most common and widely used is unripe tamarind. It is known as sampaloc in the Philippines. Other fruits such as guava, tomato, bilimbi or kamias, green mango, pineapple, and wild mangosteen or santol can be used to make the sinigang taste sour.

Of the many soups and stews that proliferate Filipino cuisine, it can be sure that sinigang has no rival. Many meals, both in childhood and adulthood, have been spent sitting in front of the familiarly flavorful broth. Its inviting aroma belies a flavor unlike no other — tart, savory, and refreshing, one can’t help but fall in love with it! With many heralding it as the national Filipino food, it comes as no surprise that its reputation has spread far and wide across the world.

Indeed, in 2021, travel guide TasteAtlas proclaimed our humble dish to be the best vegetable soup in the world! This should come as no surprise to us, either. After all, who can resist the warmth and comfort that a bowl of sinigang brings? Although a staple so common in every household, knowing that sinigang will be the main course of the day can’t help but elicit feelings of excitement and delight. No matter the weather nor the season, sinigang stands both the test of time and climate. This dish brings pleasure wherever it finds a home, and Filipinos continue to relish in its sour, but yummy taste.`,
},
{
title: `Where does sinigang come from?`,
content: `A mix of tender meat, fresh spinach, string beans, and tomatoes, as well as a dash (or more) of savory fish sauce, make for the perfect combination in simmering and incorporating each unique flavor with each other. Powerful and poignant, sinigang is a Filipino native, through and through. Its name, sinigang, originates from the Tagalog verb that directly translates to “to stew” — sigang! Because of its Tagalog name, many presume it to be Tagalog in origin as well. This yummy meal has relatives in other regions in the country as well, to be sure — yet none are quite like this classic soup that many have fallen in love with.

Again, sinigang isn’t a dish so much as it is a cooking method. This is why, like we mentioned earlier, there are a wide number of variations of this delicious dish! These include your sinigang na hipon, a favorite seafood variant. Here, tender and fresh shrimp soak up all the vibrant flavors of your beloved stew. It’s important to keep your shrimp perfectly cooked, so it’s much easier to peel the skin off later on.`,
},
{
title: `How to Cook Sinigang`,
content: `Pork Sinigang is delicious and easy to prepare. Note that this recipe will require to saute the onion and pork. Start by heating cooking oil in a cooking pot. Saute the onion until it gets soft. Add the sliced pork. We are using pork belly (or liempo) for this recipe. You may also use other pork slices such as shoulders or parts with bones. Add some fish sauce and continue to cook until the pork turns light brown.

It is time to add the liquid. This recipe calls for water. You may want to use half water and half beef broth if you prefer your sinigang to be really flavorful. Let the liquid boil and then add the tomato and taro (gabi). The tomato needs to blend in with the broth while the taro will need to cook for a longer time so that it will start to release starch that will make the soup thicker.

The souring agent for this recipe is a tamarind soup base mix, which is more popularly known assinigang mix. This is a quicker alternative to fresh tamarind and it will save you time. Add the mix once meat is tender. Add some long green chili, if desired. This will make your soup spicy good. Add the rest of the vegetables towards the last few minutes. Make sure to add the spinach last.

This is best served with a condiment composed of fish sauce and lots of hot chili pepper.`,
},
{
title: `Sinigang Alternative Ingredients`,
content: `This sinigang version makes use of pork belly. Any cuts of pork can be used to make it. Beef and fish can also be utilized.

I am using spinach in this recipe. It is actually an alternative ingredient to kangkong (water spinach), which is the most common type of leafy green vegetable used when cooking sinigang.

Sinigang mix is a powdered product that helps bring-in that good sour taste to sinigang. Old school methods requires boiling either fresh young tamarind or bilimbi for a long time until the flavors are extracted. It is your choice. It is a no-brainer, so I chose flavor and convenience.`,
},
{
title: `Tips in Cooking Pork Sinigang`,
content: `Make sure to cook the pork until very tender. I really mean it. You don’t want to challenge yourself by chewing the meat with all your might while the nice hot broth slowly cools down. Otherwise, enjoy the broth first before working on the meat.

Onion and tomato brings-in flavor to the broth. Cook it during the initial steps. Some people like their tomato intact. If you are one of these people, I suggest to cook half of the tomato initially and add the remaining once the dish is almost done.

You can still make sinigang even without all the vegetable in the list. All you need is pork, green leafy veggies, and the souring agent. Of course, water is essential for this recipe.

Busy people can use a slow cooker to cook sinigang. Make sure to add the spinach or kangkong only when you are about to eat. It is best to have these fresh.`,
},
{
title: `Is sinigang really the national dish of the Philippines?`,
content: `Though many make jokes and proclamations to the same effect, the truth of the matter is that sinigang is only the Philippine’s national dish unofficially. Regardless, some dishes may also rise to the challenge of national dish, and have separate camps of their own! Let’s take a look at some of them now.

For starters, of course, you have sinigang’s topmost competition: adobo! Point blank, adobo is perhaps sinigang’s antithesis: where the latter is sour and tart and soupy, adobo is a salty, savory and saucy dish. The only thing they have in common is their use of juicy and tender pork belly as the main protein. Like sinigang, the term adobo refers to a general cooking method, and not necessarily one particular meal. To adobo something means to marinate it in a combination of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and peppercorn. These flavors intermingle so perfectly, you wouldn’t be able to tell one from the other. The result is, to be sure, a dish that is so umami you’d want to drizzle the sauce over your entire plate of rice!`,

This delicious dessert is known throughout the world.It has been a regular item in themenu of most restaurants because of its taste, ease in preparation and long shelf life.

{
title: `What is the difference between Leche flan and creme caramel?`,
content: `It is a classic Filipino dish that was adopted from the creme caramel of European origins. However, there is a difference between these desserts. Leche flan, for one, does not use cream. And it mainly relies on evaporated milk and condensed milk for the creamy flavor. You also use condensed milk to add a level of sweetness aside from the sugar in the recipe. Furthermore, creme caramel tastes lighter. While Leche flan, at its best and most authentic, usually tastes a bit heavier, with a rich flavor.

You make this with the process of baking caramel on the bottom of a custard mold. And it is a sweet custard dessert that leaves you wanting more. This is because other than the fact that it is delectably inviting in its rich, sugary flavor, it is traditionally served in a llanera. And while this oblong metal container is very convenient for the baking process, its small size often results in careful division of the dessert among a group of people who want to share the popular custard.`,
},
{
title: `Where did Leche flan actually come from?`,
content: `In the 1500s, the Spanish colonized the Philippines. Because of their rule spanning for about 300 years, the Spanish influences had permeated themselves in many parts of Philippine culture. And this, of course, includes the cooking.

During the Spanish colonization, several Catholic missionaries came over to build churches in the Philippines. And they largely used egg whites to build msot of these churches. This is because they can be a strong adhesive when mixed with quicklime. But because of the widespread usage of egg whites, they had to find ways to utilize the egg yolks left behind.

Of course, one of the essential ingredients of a leche flan are the egg yolks. And this was how the dish was born. With leche meaning milk, the original term for the dessert was actually Leche de flan. The direct translation for this was “flan milk”. With time, they shortened the term to leche flan. And the chilled custard with caramelized sugar became even more popular with time.

Soon, the American colonization took place, which also brought about some changes for the Leche flan. Because of the arrival of canned food products, such as canned condensed milk and canned evaporated milk, most recipes now call for these ingredients strongly to create a classic Leche flan. This resulted in the largely rich, and dense taste and texture of the dessert we now know and love.`,
},
{
title: `How to Cook Leche Flan`,
content: `Making your own leche flan can be easy if you follow the recipe below and watch the cooking video. Start by beating the egg yolks in a mixing bowl. You can do it the manual way using a fork or use a hand mixer or a stand mixer. Ensure that the eggs are smooth. Gradually add the milk. Start with the condensed milk followed by the fresh milk and vanilla extract. Continue to beat all the ingredients in the bowl until these are well blended. Set this aside for the meantime while you prepare for the next process.

Grab your llanera or baking pan and place some sugar on it. Heat it over a stove top while holding the pan. Wear oven gloves to protect your hands. You will need to heat it until the sugar melts and turns into caramel. Once the happens, spread the caramel evenly on the llanera or mold that you are using. Slowly add the mixture into each mold and then cover the mold with foil.

The last process is to steam the mold. Simply arrange all the mold in a steamer and steam for a good 30 minutes or so until the mixture turns into yummy flan. At this point, you will decide if you want to dig in right away, or let it cook down a bit.`,

title: `How to Cook Turon`,
content: `Start by preparing the filling. It is composed of a piece of saba banana that is sliced in half lengthwise, and a few slices of ripe jackfruit. Dredge the banana in sugar until completely coated. You may use either brown or white sugar. Arrange the banana on a lumpia wrapper and place the jackfruit slices on top of the banana. Secure the filling by wrapping. Refer to the video below on how to wrap turon. Perform this step until all the bananas are completely consumed.

The next step is to fry the banana lumpia until golden brown. However, there is an extra step to do in order to achieve the glaze on the outer part. The secret is to first pour the remaining sugar in hot oil. Wait for the sugar to melt completely, and then start to fry the wrapped bananas in batches. The caramel (melted sugar) should automatically stick on the wrapper as you fry.Remove the fried turon from the pan, and then let the excess oil drip. Let is cool down for 5 minutes before eating.`,

description: `Tocino is a cured meat product native to the Philippines. It is sometimes referred to as sweet red pork. The curing preparation for this pork dish is similar to that of ham and bacon, except that red food coloring is needed to for this Filipino cured meat.

It was said to be named after the Spanish word “tocino”, which is used to describe cured meats.`,

title: `Pork Tocino Alternative Ingredients`,
content: `This recipe is also applicable with other types of meat. Chicken tocino is a popular version next to pork. Beef slices can also be used to make beef tocino.

There is no direct alternative to the curing ingredients when making authentic tocino. However, you can make another dish with somewhat similar flavor by initially boiling the pork slices in pineapple juice, sugar, a few pinches of salt, and a piece of star anise. Continue boiling until the liquid evaporates. Quickly fry the meat for 1 minute per side.

This version is ideal for those who prefer to make tocino the natural way. It might not look and taste exactly the same, but it is good in its own right.

Pork Tocino is usually eaten during breakfast along with warm rice. Tosilog is a popular meal comprised of garlic rice (or sinangag), fried pork tocino, and a piece of fried sunny side up egg.

One word of advice though, even how good cured meat tastes, moderate consumption is still recommended. Too much intake can still affect our health in the long run. It is best to have pork tocino at least once or twice per month. By the way, it tastes best when dipped in spicy vinegar.`,

title: `What is Lechon Kawali`,
content: `Crispy deep-fried pork is the simplest way to describe lechon kawali. Pork belly or liempo is the cut of pork usually used to cook it. This dish is best served for lunch or dinner with white rice on the side. It is also nice to have with dipping sauce.

This dish should not be mistaken with Lechon, which is considered as the national dish of the Philippines. Both dishes are prepared in a different manner. These also have different visual appearance.

Lechon kawali got its name from the type of cooking pan that is traditionally used to cook it, the Kawali. It is the typical pan that can be found in almost all Filipino household. This is the “goto” pan in everyday cooking.`,
},
{
title: `How to Cook Lechon Kawali`,
content: `There are two processes involved in cooking lechon kawali. The first process involves boiling the pork belly, while the next is deep-frying until the skin becomes crispy.

Let’s talk about the boiling process first. This is necessary to achieve that crispy skin result. Simply frying pork without boiling will have a different outcome.

It is important that the pork belly gets really tender during this step. Start by boiling water in a deep cooking pot. I also add salt and other seasonings. The flavors are absorbed by the pork while boiling. The minimum amount of time is 30 minutes. Feel free to go beyond this time as necessary. This is also the same process when making crispy pata.

Deep-frying the pork belly makes the skin golden brown and crispy. Do this by heating oil on a deep cooking pot. Make sure to rub salt all over the boiled pork belly before frying. It helps provide more flavor.

Carefully put a piece of pork belly into the pan with hot oil and put your guard up always by holding the cover of the pot. Partially cover as necessary when hot oil starts to splatter. Covering the pot totally is not recommended because it traps the steam which forms into water. This causes oil to splatter more when it drips from the base of the cover. Cook in medium heat until the pork belly is crispy. Here is a good forum that talks more about preventing oil from splattering when frying.

It is recommended to turn the pork belly over to complexly fry the opposite side when not enough oil is used. This way, your lechon kawali is cooked uniformly.

Place the deep-fried pork on a wire rack and let it cook down. Chop into serving pieces. This is best served with lechon sauce. You can also use a mixture of soy sauce and calamansi as dipping sauce.`,

{
title: `What is Tapsilog?`,
content: `The word Tapsilog is an acronym that stands for Tapa Sinangag at Itlog. These are the three components of the meal. Tapa refers to beef tapa. This are fried marinated beef slices.

Sinangag, on the other hand, is a word used to refer to garlic fried rice. The last three letters of the word tapsilog is derived from the filipino translation for egg, which is itlog. A piece of egg is fried and forms part of the meal.`,
},
{
title: `How to Cook Tapsilog`,
content: `Since Tapsilog is composed of three components, each has to be prepared and cooked individually.

The beef needs to be marinated in a mixture of crushed garlic, pineapple juice, Knorr Liquid Seasoning, sugar, and pepper. The marinade provides flavor to the meat when absorbed completely. It is best to marinate overnight or longer for best results.

I am using pineapple juice for this recipe because it provides the right amount of sourness to the beef. This is essential for a successful beef tapa, in my opinion. In addition, pineapple juice is a known meat tenderizer. This means that it tenderizes the meat while providing flavors into it.

Cooking beef tapa involves two methods for this recipe. The first method is boiling. Beef is boiled in its marinade with the addition of water in order to make it tender. Cooking oil is added in the process. Once the liquid completely evaporates, the beef gets fried in the remaining oil. Frying using the remaining oil completes the beef tapa.

Making garlic fried rice or sinangag is easier than you think. It involves four ingredients, leftover rice, salt, garlic, and cooking oil. It is ideal to use leftover rice because it is less likely to stick with each other. The more garlic, the better, as far as I am concerned.

Start cooking the rice by first browning the garlic. You can put oil and garlic in the pan at the same time and cook until the garlic turns light brown. Add half of the rice and then stir fry. This will give you enough room to blend the garlic and rice. Add remaining rice afterwards and continue to stir fry until well blended. Season with salt.

The easiest to cook among the three components is the egg. Fry the eggs based on your preference. You may also want to check other ways in cooking eggs.

Assemble your Tapsilog by combining all three components together in a large plate. Serve with spicy vinegar as dipping sauce. Banana ketchup is also nice to have with the egg.`,

description:`Longsilog is a traditional Filipino dish that's served for breakfast. The dish and its name consist of a combination of longganisa sausage, sinangag (garlic rice), and itlog (fried eggs). The Filipino-style sausages (pork, garlic, vinegar, salt, sugar) are boiled and fried in their own fat until crispy, while the garlic rice and the eggs are fried in oil.

When served, longsilog is traditionally accompanied by freshly sliced tomatoes or cucumbers.`,

title: `What is Longsilog?`,
content: `True to its name, longsilog is a breakfast that consists of sweet pork (longanisa), savory eggs, and umami garlic rice! Without even laying eyes on it, longsilog’s smell wafting through your home is enough to drag even the sleepiest out of bed. Its tantalizing aroma and humble yet comforting appearance, however, aren’t what make this dish special. In fact, it’s longsilog’s simple yet flavorful taste that is the star of the show!`,
},
{
title: `How to Make Longsilog`,
content: `Start making your longsilog by heating 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan. Once that oil gets hot, fry 2 pieces of eggs. We’re going for a sunny side, slightly over-easy egg, so that yolk is still runny when you slice it open later. Yum! (Feel free, however, to cook your eggs however you’d like.) Once you’ve cooked your egg long enough, remove it from the pan and set it aside.

Then, it’s time to add in your remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. The next part of your longsilog to cook is the longanisa itself! Fry half a pound of skinless longanisa in your pan for about a minute and a half. This should be enough time for the outer part of your sausages to turn a light brown. Pour in half a cup of water and bring it to a boil. Let it evaporate, then fry the longanisa in the remaining oil until you’ve cooked it inside out! Remove it from the pan and set it aside.

That’s 2 of the 3 components of longsilog you’ve already handled! The last component is the easiest –– sinangag, or garlic rice! Using the remaining oil from the longanisa, cook your crushed garlic in the pan until it starts to slightly brown. Add in your 4 cups of leftover rice and stir fry it for about 3 minutes. Season your sinangag with salt and pepper to taste.

Transfer all your longsilog’s components –– the longanisa, the eggs, and garlic rice –– to a plate! If you like, you can even fill a bowl with spicy vinegar as a dipping sauce for your meat. And just like that, breakfast is ready!`,

title: `What is Bulalo`,
content: `It’s a well known fact that Filipinos love stew and soup dishes. From the sour sinigang to the sweet tinola, there’s guaranteed to be a soup dish for every flavor palate preference –– all great to sip and enjoy, especially during long, cool nights. But one of the most popular, and arguably most delicious, soups out there, is the classic Bulalo, or beef shank stew.

One might classify bulalo as a kind of nilaga –– after all, there doesn’t seem to be much difference in ingredients, nor in the cooking process. But what sets bulalo apart is the very specific choice of meat we use for it. The star of a great bulalo is always the meat –– more specifically, the use of beef shank, with marrow still inside the bone. The meat of bulalo is famous for melting in your mouth, practically falling off the bone with how tender it becomes! Doesn’t the mere thought of it make your mouth water?

Bulalo may only have a few ingredients, but it takes an awful lot of patience to prepare. This is only because you have to wait for the beef to reach optimal tenderness. In this recipe, we let our bulalo sit and boil for about an hour and a half. If you have a pressure cooker it should take less time, but still a while, compared to other dishes. In fact, one and a half hours might still be short compared to other recipes, which let the bulalo simmer for much longer.

The other ingredients of bulalo are also delicious and nutritious contributions; cabbage, pechay, corn and onions are also typical ingredients in this great dish. You can also choose to add in fish sauce or patis as a substitution for salt.

Because it’s such a classic dish, there have been many variations of bulalo made by Filipinos, making this humble and already delicious dish more exciting! If you’re a fan of the classic kare-kare, my Bulalo Kare-Kare gives you the best of both worlds, combining delicious beef shank with the trademark peanut sauce. Even more different from the classic recipe is this Deep Fried Bulalo with Teriyaki Sauce! By coating the beef shank in breadcrumbs, eggs and flour, you create a dish crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. With restaurant style teriyaki sauce on the side, it makes for an amazing, yummy meal –– a great twist on a Filipino favorite!

Without question, Bulalo is a quintessential comfort food. It’s no wonder so many restaurants –– bulalohans –– have dedicated themselves to making bulalo their trademark dish. But now you won’t even have to go far to enjoy this meal; with this easy recipe, you can have Bulalo any time you’re craving the comfort of home.`,
},
{
title: `A Step by Step Guide to Making Bulalo`,
content: `The steps to making Bulalo are simple, albeit quite long because of the tenderizing process. Nonetheless, you should be able to follow this beef shank stew with ease!

An optional precursor step to making bulalo is blanching your meat to avoid excess fat and sediments. Boil your beef shanks in water over medium heat, skimming the excess fats and scum that accumulate and float on the water. After 10 minutes, take your beef out and bring it under cold running water, “cleaning” it. Once you’ve removed the excess sediments and thrown out the used water, you can now start officially cooking your bulalo

Pour 34 ounces (or about a liter) of water into a large cooking pot, bringing it to a boil. Once it starts boiling, it’s time to put in your beef shank, followed by your medium sized onion and peppercorn. If you’re using a pot, let the meat simmer for about an hour and a half. But for a pressure cooker you’ll only need about half an hour. Let your meat tenderize.

Add in your corn. For this recipe I use 3 whole corns, but cut it up into 3 parts each for convenience. Keep the bulalo simmering for another 10 minutes. After your 10 minutes are up, you can now add in your other vegetables: your cabbage, pechay, and green onion (or onion leeks). This is when you can also add in 2 tablespoons of patis, but again, this is an optional step.

Once you’ve fully cooked your vegetables, you’re ready to eat your bulalo! Serve it hot and share it with your family and friends. With a steaming cup of rice to pour your soup over, it’s definitely an awesome, unforgettable meal!`,

Protein is important for our babies and kids. They need it to support growth and physical development. Eating more protein together with soup plus with added vegetables like malunggay, will help moms produce more milk resulting to a healthier breastfeeding. Whenever there is a new mommy in our clan, my aunts will always tell them to eat malunggay because it can help increase breast milk production.

description: `In its simplest form, bibingka is a simple Filipino cake that consists of rice flour and water. It was initially prepared in clay pots that were lined with banana leaves, which would impart a distinctive, smoky flavor to the dish. Bibinka is believed to have appeared under the foreign culinary influence, and the first written reference describing a similar cake dates back to 1751.

Through history, bibinka was adapted with additional ingredients, and nowadays it is typically prepared with milk, eggs, coconut milk, sugar, and butter, while modern variations may include anything from grated cheese, salted duck eggs or grated coconut, and a variety of different sweet and savory toppings.

This original Filipino delicacy is usually associated with Christmastime, and it is traditionally enjoyed after the mass on Christmas Day. Bibingka is also often served for breakfast.`,

title: `How to Cook Bibingka`,
content: `The first step to cooking bibingka is to preheat your oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Combine your dry ingredients together in one bowl: rice flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix them well, and set them aside.

Now it’s time to cream your butter. Creaming refers to the process of making a soft fat light and fluffy. To do this, beat your butter with a whisk while gradually adding in sugar. This gives your butter a creamier, almost whipped cream-like texture. The sweet smell of butter and sugar is impossible to resist!

Crack your 3 pieces of raw egg and whisk again, until you’ve incorporated all of the ingredients. Once done, it’s now time to combine them with your dry ingredients; add them to the same bowl, and keep mixing. Then, pour in your coconut milk and fresh milk. You need 1 cup of the former, while just ¼ cup of fresh milk will do. Whisk all of your ingredients together for a minute or two more.

It’s now time to prepare your bibingka for its first round in the oven. Arrange your pre-cut banana leaf on a cake or baking pan. The leaf should be wide enough to cover not only the bottom of the pan, but also the sides. Pour the mixture onto the leaf-coated pan and put it in the oven, letting it bake for 15 minutes.

Once your timer is up, remove your bibingka from the oven. Doesn’t that smell absolutely delicious? The use of a banana leaf also lends to the fragrant aroma. But at this point your bibingka isn’t quite ready to be eaten yet. Top your rice cake with sliced salted egg and grated cheese. At this point in time, your oven should still be kept on –– you’ll still need to use it!

With its new coat of toppings, put the bibingka back in the oven. Let it bake for another 15 to 20 minutes –– or, wait until the top of your rice cake turns a medium brown. Whichever comes first, remove it from the oven afterwards and let it cool.

Brush your bibingka with butter and sprinkle sugar on top. If you’re more of a coconut fan, you can opt to top it with that instead of sugar. And just like that, your bibingka is ready to be enjoyed!`,

Marinated or dried fish is used in numerous Filipino dishes as an ingredient, side dish, topping, or a condiment which gives flavor to various stewed or stir-fried dishes.

Though it originated as a preservation technique, today it is produced in many traditional Filipino households and sold at numerous markets throughout the country.`,

content: `Daing na Bangus refers to milkfish that is marinated in a mixture composed of vinegar, crushed peppercorn, garlic, and salt. Hot pepper such as cayenne pepper powder can be added to make it spicy. It is usually marinated overnight for best results, and then fried until crispy.

Unlike traditional daing wherein the fish is salted and then soaked under the sun for a day or two, this daing na bangus recipe in particular, do not need the heat of the sun. This makes this version more pleasurable because the meat do not get tough ( which often happens to most dried fishes).

Daing na bangus is best for breakfast and lunch. The term BangSiLog ws coined from a meal combination composed of daing na bangus, Sinangag (garlic fried rice), and fried egg. It can also be eaten simply with warm white rice.`,

The last step is to assemble everything together. Put some soft silken tofu on a mug. Microwave for a minute. Top with arnibal and sago pearls.`,

{
title: `Cooking Sago`,
content: `Large sago pearls takes awhile to cook completely. I do it by boiling the sago in water for 30 minutes. Add sugar and continue to boil for another 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked all throughout.

It is best to let the pearls soak in water for a few hours or overnight. Smaller sago pearls are the opposite. These cook quicker. The key when cooking small sago has something to do with the temperature of the water. Always make sure that the water is rapidly boiling before adding these. Otherwise, the small pearls will just get diluted in water.`,

title: `How to Cook Dinuguan`,
content: `Start by sautéing garlic and onion. This is a common practice when cooking Filipino dishes. Make sure that the onion softens before adding the pork. Saute the meat until it turns light brown. This recipe suggest the use of any boneless cut of pork. Cook it until it turns light brown. Feel free to add innards. Check this recipe and use it as a guide.

Tenderize the pork by boiling. Pour water, cover the pot, and cook in low heat until tender. Adding a piece of pork cube (bouillon) is a big help to make the dish taste meatier.

Pour the pork blood while stirring and cook it for at least 8 minutes to make sure that it is fully done. Add vinegar and the remaining ingredients. Some people would add vinegar before the blood. It is up to you to choose the sequence.

You will notice that brown sugar is one of the key ingredients in this version. This is not a substitute for MSG as I would say in my other videos. It is added to help improve the overall taste of the stew.

Season with salt and pepper. Dinuguan can be enjoyed with rice or with puto.`,

title: `Where did Chicken Mechado come from?`,
content: `This scrumptious slow cook stew has graced Filipino tables for as long as anyone can remember. Like many of our dishes, chicken mechado—and mechado in general, really—is inspired by the culinary methods of Spain. The original version of this dish is actually one you make with beef. Fun fact: Did you know that the name mechado comes from the Spanish mecha, meaning candle wick? This is because mechado’s beef resembled that of a candle!

Over time, our love for mechado has definitely, doubtlessly grown. Newer and more modern versions of this dish have changed things from the protein to additional add ons. For instance, pork mechado is another variation of this delicious dish that uses juicy and tasty pork instead of the sumptuous beef. Chicken mechado is not only more affordable and accessible, but it’s a healthy alternative for those who want less fat but the same flavors.`,
},
{
title: `What sets Chicken Mechado apart?`,
content: `With the many mouthwatering dishes Filipino cuisine has to offer, it’s sometimes hard to find what each one’s unique selling point is. Even among tomato-based stews alone, chicken mechado has quite the competition. Caldereta, afritada, and menudo are other Filipino favorites that make use of the bright and vibrant tomato. So how does mechado measure up and set itself apart from the rest?

The answer lies in the marinade we use for braising the meat. Beyond just the tomato sauce, soy sauce and lemon (sometimes people use calamansi) are equally important in bringing out that rich mechado flavor. This combination of tartness and umami tastes is definitely one chicken mechado can easily lord over other dishes. It cuts through the rich and refreshing taste of tomato, adding more layers and depth that avoid making it a one-track mind dish. And anyone who’s ever had chicken mechado knows that this is definitely the tasty, yummy result!

Chicken mechado isn’t just delicious, but it’s also incredibly easy to make! You’ll have to set aside some time to do so, considering how long your chicken needs in the pan, but the results are definitely worth it. What are you waiting for? Let’s get to cooking chicken mechado today!`,

{
title: `How to Cook Beef Mechado`,
content: `Cooking beef mechado is easier than you might be thinking. The first process is to saute the meat along with garlic and onion. Next is to tenderize it. The last part is to add the seasonings, spices, and other ingredients.

Start to saute by heating oil in a pot. Saute garlic and onion, and then add the beef. It is a good practice to soften the onion before adding the meat. This makes the onion taste sweeter. Add the beef and cook until all sides turn light brown. You’ll need to stir to cook the sides.

Add tomato sauce and water. Let boil. It is time to tenderize the meat. Cover the pot, adjust the heat between low to medium, and cook for 60 minutes or longer until the beef gets tender. You can add more water to prevent the sauce from drying-up during the process.

Add the remaining ingredients. Make sure to adjust the taste based on your preference. This means adding enough salt and pepper. You now have your Beef Mechado to enjoy.`,
},
{
title: `Tips and Tricks`,
content: `• A good tip is to cook rice while waiting for the meat to tenderize. It might sound funny, but some of us are focused too much in cooking the dish to the point that other components of the meal are forgotten. This will ensure that you can enjoy your meal right after the stew is done.

• Use a pressure cooker to tenderize the beef faster. It can save you time by 70%.

• You can also use a slow cooker if preferred.

• Other types of protein such as pork and chicken can also be utilized for this dish.`,

content: `You have the option to make your arroz caldo yellowish if preferred. It may or may not have an effect on the flavor of the dish. It depends on the ingredient that you will use.

An ingredient known as safflower is traditionally used when cooking this dish. It is locally known in the Philippines as kasubha. The corollas of the safflower plant can be either yellow or red. The red variety is commonly used for arroz caldo. It creates a yellowish color when cooked.

Safflower has no flavor at all. It does not affect the overall taste of the dish. However, there is an ingredient that I sometimes used which makes the dish taste better. It is called saffron. This is what’s in my Pina-sosyal na arroz caldo recipe.`,

I like to infuse the dish with flavors at the start. This is the reason why I also add a bit of fish sauce into it in the early stages. Add the rice afterwards and pour-in water. The amount of water will depend on the consistency of the dish. Make sure to stir every few minutes while cooking until the desired consistency is achieved.

Boiled eggs are regular components. I add these during the last steps of the cooking process. You can also add it later when you are about to serve the dish.

Add the safflower and adjust the flavor by adding more seasonings if needed. Top with toasted garlic and chopped scallions. It is best to squeeze some lemon or calamansi on top before eating.`,

title: `Arroz Caldo and Lugaw`,
content: `You might be familiar with lugaw and goto. These types of congee closely resembles each other. The distinguishing ingredient of arroz caldo is the use of chicken.

Lugaw can be as plain as it can get. It can be cooked using only three ingredients. The simplest lugaw is composed of rice, water, and salt. My grandma always makes this for me when I am not feeling well. She adds an ingredient called rousong to make it taste better.

Goto is another type of congee. This is usually composed of beef tripe. Beef and pork innards are sometimes added into it.`,
},
{
title: `Cooking Tips`,
content: `To make your arroz caldo look and taste better, try topping it with some safflower, toasted garlic, and scallions — squeeze half a lemon and you are done.

Arroz Caldo is usually served during breakfast because it is filling. It can give you the energy that you will need until lunch time.`,

description: `This comforting Filipino stew usually combines diced marinated pork, carrots, potatoes, and pork's liver with a creamy tomato sauce. Since it is one of the national Filipino dishes, numerous regional varieties often employ raisins, bell peppers, garbanzo beans, and sausages.

The name menudo probably stems from menudencias, meaning offal, which might suggest that the dish used to include other innards, though pork liver is the most common option nowadays. It can also refer to small or tiny, possibly referring to the size of the ingredients.

Menudo is typically prepared for every important event in the Philippines and comes with steamed rice served on the side.`,

{
title: `How to Cook Pork Menudo`,
content: `This pork menudo recipe requires the meat to be marinated in soy sauce and lemon first before cooking. Combine the pork, soy sauce and lemon in a bowl. Mix well and let it stay for at least 1 hour. It will be better to store the bowl inside the refrigerator while you marinate to avoid contamination. Make sure to cover the bowl before doing this.

Take the pork out of the fridge 15 minutes before cooking. Start to saute the garlic and onion. You will notice that this method is common in Filipino cuisine. Most Filipino foods are cooked starting with sauteing garlic and onion.

Once the onions are soft, add the marinated pork and cook until it browns. Add tomato sauce (you can also use crushed tomatoes), water (or beef broth), and bay leaves. We are using dried bay leaves for this recipe. Cover and simmer until the meat gets tender — which is usually 40 to 60 minutes depending on the quality of the meat. Once the meat is done, it is time to add the sliced liver. You can add the liver fresh or you can saute it first in ginger and garlic to make it less gamey. Add the veggies after this step and continue to cook for a few more minutes.

Add the salt and pepper depending on your preference. Also, try not to overcook the potato and carrots because itwill get very soft — unless you prefer it that way.`,
},
{
title: `How can I best store it?`,
content: `Menudo can make for an incredibly tempting dish to finish all on your own. But considering how jam-packed it is with ingredients, you might find yourself unable to eat all of it in one sitting. But never fear, as this dish can actually get better with more time in storage. With all of your flavors— from the garlic to the tomato sauce— settling in nicely over time, you might get a richer taste from more days of letting it rest. Simply make sure that you’re storing it properly, and that you keep an eye on how long you’re setting it aside so that it doesn’t rot.

For this, we will be refrigerating the Pork Menudo. With that, you have to make sure that your dish is down to room temperature before we do anything else, as it might still be hot off the stove. When it’s perfectly cool, you can put it in a resealable bag, or any airtight container you might have.

Then slip this into your refrigerator for about 3 days of your Menudo staying great for consumption. But if you need it for an event or a meal that’s a little further in the future, feel free to place it in your freezer. You can expect this to last for 2 months when you freeze it.`,
},
{
title: `What if I’m ready to eat it again, and would like to reheat it?`,
content: `One of the most ideal ways to go about this is by using your stove again, and pouring your mixture back into a saucepan. You can reheat the Menudo over low heat, until you get an internal temperature of about 165 °F. This would mimic the taste of your freshly cooked Menudo.

But if you’re in a bit of a hurry, there’s also the option of microwaving. This is also best for if you’ve stored some of this dish to bring to work. All you have to do is take that Menudo you’ve packed away, and microwave it within intervals of 2 to 3 minutes. Keep checking your dish if it’s warm enough for you. Also make sure that you use a microwave-safe container for this.

Now you’ve got a lovely plate of Pork Menudo all ready to go! This is definitely a dish that involves numerous ingredients. As such, it really might be best to make a bigger batch, and store the leftovers for later eating.

And there are many other recipes that have that similar charm of being a gorgeous, flavorful mix of various components. But there are three in particular that usually get bunched together in Filipino cuisine for how alike they are to one another.`,

According to popular belief, it was invented by Soledad Pahud, a native Filipino who spent some time working in the United States. After she had returned, she wanted to adapt the traditional American apple pie with locally available ingredients. Together with her family, she invented buko pie, a dessert which soon became a favorite throughout the country.

Apart from being a delicious dessert, buko pie is one of the most popular Filipino souvenirs.`,

title: `What Is Bopis?`,
content: `As we mentioned prior, bopis is essentially slices of pig lungs with other ingredients that give it that tart and spicy taste. It is said that bopis has Spanish origins, though there doesn’t seem to be any record of the meaning of the word in the original language. Regardless, the same vibrant flavors you expect of any Spanish-influenced dish are definitely present here! The type of bopis dishes are endless; some opt for simply pork lungs, while others go for the heart, too. Others even use beef! Whatever you prefer, this meat is sautéed and stir-fried until crispy, giving you that extra layer of texture in each bite. It’s delicious!

You usually mix the meat with a combination of carrots, onions, and tomatoes. Ginger, annatto powder, and Thai chili peppers are what give you that additional flavor you’ve come to know and love in bopis. Aromatic and addictive, the scent of this dish is only a teaser to the piquancy you and your loved ones are sure to enjoy. Like another Kapampangan favorite, sisig, some opt to serve bopis on a sizzling plate. This adds to the dish’s crunchiness and makes it more exciting — especially when you serve it with rice!

The combination of spicy and sour isn’t one you often see executed as well as it is in a perfect plate of bopis. This Kapampangan favorite is an excellent mesh of two seemingly opposite flavors. From the hot and spicy to the zesty and tart, each bite packs a punch that’ll keep you coming back for more. Whether you’re eating it as a standalone or with cups (and cups) of rice, bopis is more than just a staple — it’s loved across the Philippines!

Big, bold, bright — these three b words encapsulate bopis perfectly. And when you want to give it a try, you might have to be a little brave, too. After all — did you know that this hearty dish is made with pork lungs? Like many other Filipino dishes, this recipe knows not to waste any single part of the precious pig! While you might scrunch your nose up at the notion of eating pork lungs, don’t worry! Tap into your adventurous side, and you might even find your next favorite meal. Bopis is the perfect place to start on your daring culinary experience.`,
},
{
title: `Tips for Cooking Bopis`,
content: `It’s very important that you’ve cleaned your pork lungs properly before continuing your cooking process. This ensures that you can enjoy this scrumptious dish as safely as you possibly can! Another important step is ensuring that your organs are tender enough to chew on, too. You can achieve this by putting your pig parts in a pot of boiling water. Couple this with bay leaves and sibot, and your lungs are sure to not only be tender — but tasty, too!

Equally important is ensuring that you have just enough vinegar, and that you don’t stir it in right away. Do this, and your dish may end up more sour than it should, completely forsaking the spicy. Wait a few moments before stirring, or even pour the water in first. This will guarantee that your dish is perfectly balanced, as it should be.

Armed with these tips, making bopis is sure to be a piece of cake! Read on to find out the easy steps to this Filipino classic.`,
},
{
title: `Bopis Recipe`,
content: `Boil 8 cups of water in a large pot alongside 5 dried bay leaves and 25 grams of sibot. Then, put in three pounds of pig’s lungs and let it boil for about an hour. When your time is up, remove the lungs from the pot, letting them cool down before slicing them. Take your small pieces and set them aside for later. Meanwhile, in another pot, heat cooking oil and sauté garlic, onion, and ginger.

Now, add in the lungs you had diced prior. Do this when your onions softened, and cook these together for about three minutes. Vinegar goes in next; use five tablespoons, and cook for two minutes. After this, pour 2 ½ cups of water into the pot and once again bring it to a boil. Toss in your Knorr Pork Cube and another 5 bay leaves, and stir. Cover your pot and bring your heat between low to medium. The goal is to get your liquid to evaporate by half before continuing to make your bopis.

Did your liquid lessen? Now you can add in your carrot, chili peppers, and annatto powder. For 3 minutes, cook your bopis and mix thoroughly. Don’t forget to season with ground black pepper and patis (or fish sauce) to taste!

When you’re happy with the end product, it’s time to serve your bopis! Transfer your dish to a serving plate, and share and enjoy! Whether it’s with rice or a cold one, your bopis will be a smashing success. Let us know what you and your family think of this jewel!`,

title: `How to Cook Maja Blanca`,
content: `Preparing Maja Blanca is quick easy. This Filipino dessert is something that I recommend for aspiring home cooks. All you have to do is basically cook everything in a pot and arrange it in a tray afterwards.

The first thing to do is to boil coconut milk in a pot. Fresh coconut milk is ideal. However, you can always use canned coco milk depending on the availability of ingredients. Simply pour coconut milk in a pot and apply heat. Keep an eye on the pot. Coconut milk has a tendency to splatter before boiling. I recommend to stir it every minute until it completely boils.

Add sugar once the bubbles surface. Stir until well blended. You can add the condensed milk and corn afterwards. Make sure to constantly stir the mixture while cooking. The recipe calls for whole kernel corn. Canned cream style corn can also be utilized.

This desert dish should be thick and smooth. Cornstarch is responsible for its texture and form. Simply dilute it fresh milk or evaporated milk, and then pour into the mixture. Keep on stirring until the mixture thickens and becomes smooth.

Transfer the entire mixture to a tray. Make sure to spread it evenly. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until firm. It is best to top it with toasted grated coconut, or with latik.`,

Tapa is typically either grilled or pan-fried, and it is best enjoyed when served as a part of the so-called tapsilog, which is a portmanteau of the Filipino words tapa and sinangag, meaning garlic-fried rice, and itlog, meaning eggs.

Tapsilog is often accompanied by sliced tomatoes ot pickled papaya strips called atchara. Altogether, this delicious combination is popularly known as the Philippine-style breakfast of champions, and to most Filipinos, it is a favorite way to start the day.`,

description: `Bicol express is a popular Filipino dish consisting of sliced pork that is doused in a creamy coconut-based sauce and seasoned with shrimp paste and spicy chili peppers. According to popular belief, Cely Kalaw invented the dish in her Manila restaurant.

She was inspired by the traditional Bicolano coconut-infused dishes and named the new invention after a Filipino train service operating from Manila to the Bicol region. Creamy and spicy Bicol express is usually served with plain steamed rice on the side.`,

title: `Health Benefits`,
content: `As mentioned earlier, the distinct bite and heat brought on by this dish can make it great for the colder seasons. But even if it could be perfect for a chilly day, the majority of Filipinos enjoy serving it in all seasons. Perhaps it is because of its advantageous amount of protein, making for a very satisfying and filling dish.

Pork is a fantastic source of not just protein, but also niacin, phosphorus and vitamin B6. In fact, in 3 ounces of pork, you can find more nutrients that are great for you. This includes zinc and potassium.

But it is not just the meat that brings some comfort to your health in this dish. One of our main flavor and texture components, coconut milk, has healthy micronutrients. These aid in decreasing the size of stomach ulcers, and can help in lessening inflammation. It also contains a great deal of protein and carbs to boost your energy.

However, this well-recognized love for the nutritious viand has brought about some controversy to the origin of the recipe. Because who else wouldn’t want to take credit for such a brilliantly formulated array of flavors?`,
},
{
title: `The dispute over its history`,
content: `This may come as a surprise, but the most widely credited origin of this spicy white dish is actually in Manila, and not Bicol. While most residents from the Bicol area argue that it came from them, most, including big names in the Philippine cooking industry, have said that Bicol Express was born in Cely Kalaw’s restaurant in the country’s capital.

In the 1960s, Kalaw decided to present a creamy dish with the slightest punch. After some struggle in entitling the dish, her ears caught the sound of the daily train headed to Bicol. And that was when she got the idea to name it after a train going the Manila-Naga route.

Apparently, this recipe hoped to be a less flavorful or spicy rendition of Laing. This is a local dish made of dried taro leaves, and similar to our dish of choice, rich coconut milk.

Bicol Express quickly grew in popularity. And soon, the dish began popping up in several other dining establishments in the country. But what most people didn’t know by then was that the dish did not exactly originate from the region in its own name.`,
},
{
title: `A similar dish to Bicol Express from the region:`,
content: `The argument held by most Bicolanos is that a recipe very alike to that of Bicol Express came from their place of residence. Ginataang Sili, otherwise known as Gulay na Lada, contains balao, which is a shrimp paste variation. It also has other similar ingredients like pork, and none other than coconut milk. Some have said that Kalaw may have gotten inspiration from Gulay na Lada. And this was especially to bring the heat down from her Laing recipe.

But at the same time, some have said that Kalaw never denied gaining inspiration from Bicolano dishes for her dish. They say it is still essentially a name she coined. And likewise, it was her own culinary invention as a result of experimenting in the kitchen, and gaining inspiration from other dishes.

Now if this narrative’s encouraged you to try your own hand at making some deliciously spicy pork belly infused with coconut milk in the kitchen, I have the recipe for you. Try making this classic Bicol Express recipe with me!`,

Once the mixture boils, you may add a cup of coconut cream and half of the bagoong alamang. Let the mixture cook using low heat until it reduces to a quarter.

Afterwards, we will add the rest of the coconut cream and adjust the flavor by adding more bagoong if necessary. Also add the Serrano peppers or long green pepper.Continue cooking in low heat until the sauce thickens.Make sure to serve this nice and hot, and you now have enough Bicol Express for 6! Also try serving it the traditional manner– with some steaming, white rice.`,

description: `Pares is a Filipino term that typically refers to a standard combination of beef stew, beef soup, and rice. The star is the stew consisting of beef chunks that are slowly braised in a flavorful stock infused with garlic, soy sauce, star anise, sugar, and a variety of other spices and condiments.

The thick, rich, and slightly sweet sauce and tender meat make pares one of the most popular beef dishes in the country. The term pares translates as pairs and stems from the traditional practice of serving this satisfying stew along with fried or steamed rice and a bowl of nourishing beef stock.

This traditional comfort food is commonly found in many Filipino establishments (carenderias), which all have their signature pares recipes.`,

{
title: `How to Cook Beef Pares`,
content: `It is best to always have the beef stock ready before cooking pares. This is the soup that goes with it.

Cooking beef pares is easier when using a pressure cooker. This helps tenderize the beef quickly. Start by sauteing onion, garlic, and ginger. These aromatics brings-in flavor and aroma to your dish. Make sure that the onion softens. This makes it sweeter.

Add the beef and continue to saute until it browns. Pour-in water and then add a piece of Knorr Beef Cube and 2 pieces of star anise. Pressure cook for 15 minutes. You can cook it longer up to 20 minutes, but make sure that the beef is still intact. Add sugar and season with salt and ground black pepper.`,
},
{
title: `Making Beef Stock`,
content: `Beef pares is not complete without the soup. There are two ways to have it. The fastest way is to purchase beef stock or broth from the supermarket. The ideal way is to making it from scratch. This option takes time and should be done in advance. Here is how I do it. Start preparing the soup using beef bones. Beef neck bones the ones that I used in this recipe. I chose this part to make beef stock because it has a good ratio of bone to meat.

It is best to broil the beef bones in the oven before boiling. Doing this makes it more flavorful. This is optional, but it makes a difference. Place the bones in a baking tray. Set the oven to broil. Keep the bones in there for 20 minutes.

It’s time to make the soup or the stock. Pour 6 cups water in a cooking pot. Let it boil. Add the beef bones and mirepoix (carrot, celery, and onion). I also add 3 tablespoons of vinegar to the mix. This helps break down the collagen making your stock more gelatinous. It also helps improve the taste of the stock overall. I add a piece of Knorr Beef Cube to give it that solid beef flavor. This needs to cook in low heat for at least 3 hours for the shortcut version. Best results are seen when simmering the bones for more than 8 hours. It is your choice. Season with salt.`,
},
{
title: `Cooking Garlic Fried Rice`,
content: `Sinangag na kanin is the Filipino term for it. Cold leftover rice is perfect to use in making sinangag. It involves combining salt and rice and mixing together before cooking. Crispy browned garlic makes sinangag a winner. This is done by frying the garlic in low heat until it turns light brown, and the the rice and salt mixture is added and cooked all together until done. Use this sinangag recipe as a guide.`,
},
{
title: `Tips in Cooking Beef Pares`,
content: `It is best to make the soup from scratch and always prepare it in advance to save time. Do a large batch and freeze the remaining stock for future use.

Pour a few tablespoons of beef pares sauce into your soup before eating to make it even more flavorful. It will be tastier.

A pressure cooker is your friend in the kitchen. Use this to quickly cook your beef pares.

Star anise is an important ingredient for pares, as far as I am concerned. Try to use half a teaspoon of five spice powder if this is not available.`,

Lugaw is also traditionally prepared as a part of the Christmas Eve celebratory meal known as Noche Buena.`,

title: `How to Cook Beef Kaldereta`,
content: `The first part of the process is to sauté beef with garlic and onion. Start by heating oil in wide pot. Cook the garlic, onion, and beef. Continue to saute the beef until the color browns a bit. Add bay leaves and crushed peppercorn. Continue by adding liver spread, tomato sauce, and beef broth.

The beef needs to be cooked until tender. You can do it the traditional way by cooking it in a regular cooking pot over the stove top. This takes around 60 to 90 minutes. A faster way to tenderize beef is to cook it using a pressure cooker. It can save you time by more than half.

Go ahead and add the vegetables and seasonings. Cook for around 10 minutes and it’s done. The cooking process is simple and straightforward.

Beef Kaldereta is best eaten with warm white rice.`,

title: `How to Cook Kalderetang Kambing`,
content: `Grab your large bowl, and start putting your 1 lb. of cubed goat meat, preferably Chevon, inside. Now add ½ cup of vinegar, and some salt and pepper to your taste. Mix this together nicely, and let this marinate for a minimum of an hour. As mentioned earlier, this is essential in making the meat less gamey. After this, you can take the meat out of the marinade, and we can get ready to cook. 

Take your cooking pot or casserole, and place 3 tablespoons of cooking oil inside. Let this heat up for a bit. And then add your 1 tablespoon of garlic, 1 medium-sized onion, both of which are minced. Also incorporate your 2 medium-sized tomatoes that are diced into the mix. Sauté all of these together. 

Afterwards, you can go ahead and use the goat meat we marinated earlier. Place this inside the pot as well. And then let it cook until you can see the outer area of the meat turning light brown. This would be your sign to add 1 cup of tomato sauce, as well as your ½ teaspoon of crushed chili if you’re comfortable with some heat. You could also use fresh Thai chili for this ingredient as an alternative.

We will be cooking this for 2 minutes, and then pouring in 2 cups of water. Wait for the water to boil. And when it begins boiling, you should let it simmer for a minimum of 45 minutes, or at least until our goat meat is perfectly tender.`,

{
title: `What is Pochero`,
content: `Puchero or Putsero, which means “stewpot,” was brought to our shores by centuries-long Spanish colonization and adapted over the years to suit our local ingredients.

This peasant stew is composed of cuts of beef, chicken, pork, or fish cooked in tomato sauce along with fresh produce like potatoes, saba bananas, chickpeas, cabbage, pechay, and green beans, and cured meats such as Chorizo de Bilbao or ham to add a smoky flavor.`,
},
{
title: `Cooking Tips`,
content: `• Although you can use boneless chicken meat if you like, I suggest bone-in for extra depth of flavor.

• You can swap the potatoes with sweet potatoes or the carrots with turnips for variety.

• Along with pechay and cabbage, other vegetables such as leeks, bok choy, and celery are also great additions.

• Garbanzo beans are the traditional legume used in the stew but other regional versions use canned pork and beans.

• Saba bananas lend a touch of sweetness that works really with the savory notes of the dish. Choose ripe but firm bananas and briefly pan-fry to help maintain shape.

• Chorizo de bilbao adds a smoky flavor; feel free to substitute bacon or ham.`
},
{
title: `How to Serve and Store`,
content: `• Pocherong Manok is traditionally served as a Sunday lunch or on special occasions for the whole family to gather around. It’s enjoyed as a hearty and satisfying meal with steamed rice.

• Stored in resealable bags or airtight containers, the stew will keep in the refrigerator for up to three days or in the freezer for up 2 months.

• Reheat in the microwave at 2 to 3-minute intervals or in a saucepan over medium heat until the internal temperature reads 165 F.`,

This Filipino spaghetti version makes use of store-bought Filipino Style spaghetti sauce (this is also sometimes labeled as Filipino Style Tomato Sauce), instead of making one from scratch.`,

content: `• This spaghetti version makes use of store bought Filipino Spaghetti Sauce. If this product is not available in your location, you can use regular tomato sauce and add some sugar. The amount of sugar will depend on your taste. You can also add banana ketchup, but you can do without it.

• The luncheon meat plays a big role in making the sauce taste meatier. You can also use potted meat as an alternative to it.

• You can use any type of grated cheese. Cheddar is the most common, while quickmelt cheeses are also used by some people. Queso de bola or Edam cheese also works too.

• Follow the package instructions when cooking the noodles for best results.`,

{
title: `How to Cook Chicken Afritada`,
content: `Start by sautéing garlic and onion. Do this by heating oil in a cooking pot. Add onion and garlic until the onion softens. It is ideal to use a pot with cover.

Add the sliced chicken afterwards. Bone-in chicken was used for this recipe. Boneless chicken breast or thighs can also be used. Cook each side of the chicken for around 30 seconds and then pour tomato sauce and water. We’ll need to tenderize the chicken at this point. This is when the pot cover gets handy. Add the bay leaves and then cover the pot and continue to cook until the chicken gets tender. This takes around 30 minutes. Remember to add more broth or water if needed.

At this point, we just need to add the remaining ingredients and continue to cook for 10 more minutes. I usually add the ingredients in this order: hot dogs, carrot, potato, green peas, seasoning. Fish sauce or patis can be used as an alternative ingredient to salt.`,

{
title: `How did Chicken Afritada come to be?`,
content: `As far as tomato-based viands in the Philippines go, Chicken Afritada stands as one of the most famous. Practically every household has their own rendition of the delicious Apritadang Manok. It’s go its delicious share of potatoes, peas, and that unmistakably flavorful and thick orange stew. But do you know how this dish actually came to life? It might surprise you to know that this is mainly because of how Filipino cooks learned to pan-fry their food.

We may be familiar with a good deal of Filipino recipes that arose in the Spanish colonization era that lasted until 1898. But Afritada, in particular, came to life because of the cooking method of pan-frying that the Spaniards brought over. Filipino cooks went on to formulate the idea of a recipe wherein the cook would start off by pan-frying potatoes, carrots and other vegetables, as well as chicken. This is before we leave it to stew in a savory mix of garlic, bay leaves, and more delightfully complementary seasonings.

If you’re familiar with the etymology of the dish, its origin probably wouldn’t seem too much of a surprise. After all, you can directly translate “to fry” into Spanish with “a fritada”. Some have also attributed the dish to the Spanish “chilidrón”. This involves letting fried chicken or lamb simmer in garlic, tomatoes, bell peppers, and many other ingredients. These similar recipes show how closely integrated the two types of cuisine could be with one another.

And speaking of similar recipes, you might have also heard of Kaldereta and Mechado, both of which have their own orange, meaty stews.`,
},
{
title: `What is the difference among Afritada, Kaldereta and Mechado?`,
content: `One principal difference among the three is the main ingredients we use to create their unique flavors. While all use up tomato sauce to create that orange color, only Kaldereta utilizes liver spread (and peanut butter in some regions). We cook it alongside tomato sauce to enhance its savory flavor. And Mechado uses up vinegar (or a bit of calamansi or lemon) for a subtle sourness. And it is more commonly known to use either pork or beef. Afritada is the only one out of the three that uses chicken in its original recipe as the meat ingredient. Meanwhile, Kaldereta shows off beef as its meat counterpart.

But one thing you should also be familiar with when it comes to Chicken Afritada is the good it can bring for your body.`,
},
{
title: `How should I store and reheat my Chicken Afritada?`,
content: `Say you’ve gotten all the steps down, and have served your perfectly bright and filling stew of chicken and vegetables. But what do you do if there are leftovers? Or what if you’ve simply done the recipe for a future gathering, and aren’t looking to eat it right away? There are some ways around this, and one of the key components to our storage is an airtight container.

Start by grabbing an airtight container that can fit all of your ingredients and stew. Place your Afritada inside, then put this in the refrigerator. If you keep it refrigerated in the container, you can expect that this would be great for eating for about 3 to 4 days more. But you also have the option of freezing for an even longer shelf life.

Try using a heavy-duty freezer bag or an airtight container for your Chicken Afritada. Then place it in your freezer to make it last longer, or about 3 to 4 months more. And once you decide you’re ready to have some of this thick, delicious stew again, you can take it out of the freezer or refrigerator. Wait for it to thaw completely, and then you can use a microwave-safe container to reheat it in your microwave. You also have the option of placing this in a pot, and reheating it straight on your stove.

But considering how lusciously flavorful this dish is, you might expect your Chicken Afritada to run out after a small while. Of course, you always have the choice of clicking right back on this link to try out the recipe again. But if you’d like to integrate a bit more variety into your Afritada cooking, I’ve got the key recipes for this!`,

description: `Pork Afritada is a Filipino pork stew that resembles pork menudo. It is composed of pork shoulder that are cut into 1 inch cubes, carrot, potato, and tomato sauce. This step-up recipe also includes green pea, freshly chopped tomato, and bay leaves.

A warm and inviting stew, afritada is as bright in flavor as it is in appearance! One glance of that vibrant red-orange sauce, and you definitely know you’re in for a treat. Afritada brims with flavor, which you can tell quite plainly from its equally mouthwatering aroma. When it wafts through the air, it’s impossible to resist. Indeed, whether it be through sight, smell, or taste, this Filipino favorite is a festival for all your senses! With a combination of tender pork that both falls off the bone and melts in your mouth, as well as fresh and chunky vegetables, what’s not to love about pork afritada?`,

title: `What is the Difference Between Afritada, Menudo, and Kaldereta?`,
content: `Pork Afritada is almost Filipino Menudo. The ingredeints are identical and the manner of preparation is almost the same. The only difference that is quite obvious is the size of the cubed meat and vegetables. It is more than twice bigger than regular cuts for menudo. Another difference would be the possibility of adding raisins in menudo, which does not sound too common for an afritada dish to have.

Kaldereta, on the other hand, has its own identity that differentiates it from both dishes. The typical kaldereta makes use of liver spread. This ingredient is not commonly added when cooking afritada or menudo.`,
},
{
title: `Where does pork afritada come from?`,
content: `Like much of our food (and our culture), afritada has Spanish origins. The name for this flavorful stew even comes from the Spanish food, fritada or “fried.” Although pork afritada is a stew that takes on a braising method, the dish it gets its name from is one wherein the meat is pan-fried before allowing it to simmer in tomato sauce. In other dishes, fritada is crispy and golden brown, accompanied by a citrusy sauce. While it may vary in preparation, pork afritada and fritada both make use of pork in the best way possible!`,
},
{
title: `What pork cut do you use in this dish?`,
content: `For this pork afritada recipe, we’ll be using pork shoulder! I’m a fan of this pork cut, also known as kasim, because of how forgiving a meat it is. It tenderizes well, especially during braising, and it can be quite difficult to get it tough. There’s a nice layer of fat that comes with this portion, but it’s just enough to give you extra juiciness. This cut is also fairly affordable when you compare it to other parts of the pig!`,

description: `Pata tim is a traditional Filipino dish with Chinese influences, made with a combination of pata (pork leg), seasoning cube, bok choy, shiitake mushrooms, brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, cornstarch, peppercorns, and star anise. The pork leg is broiled, boiled, drained, washed, then arranged in a cooking pot with soy sauce, sesame oil, water, and peppercorns.

The combination is simmered until the pata becomes tender. The other ingredients are then added to the pot and cooked a bit more until the sauce thickens. The sauce should be mild and slightly sweet, while the pork leg should be as tender as possible.

Pata tim is often served with steamed white rice on the side.`,

title: `Pata Tim Renditions`,
content: `Some variations like to input a good deal of banana blossoms into the pork stew. This ingredient provides a very delicious sour contrast to the dish’s sweetness. It also contains several antioxidants for your body, and also has anti-microbal properties. As such, adding these banana blossoms helps hype up your Pata Tim dish into one that aids your digestive system, and improves your health in sleeping.

And from province to province, there are varying renditions of Pata Tim that also integrate more ingredients to the classic dish. For example, in Pampanga, pineapple juice is integrated into the stew, as well as lime softdrink or Sprite. Not only that, but you can also find yourself munching on pineapple chunks when you taste a Kapampangan Pata Tim. With this, we can tell that there is an added factor of sweetness to the province’s adaptation.

The gracious Pata Tim is only living proof of how easily food can evolve and adjust based on the culture and place at which it resides. This Filipino-Chinese dish is far more than its solidly rich flavors. It is also a longstanding example of the creativity that comes with the art of cooking.`,

Water is added, and the shrimps are stirred and cooked until the liquid evaporates. Once done, halabos na hipon is served hot on a large plate. If desired, a bit of garlic powder, butter, or red chili flakes can be added to the dish while it's cooking.

Some people also like to replace water with soda such as 7-Up or Sprite. It's recommended to serve halabos na hipon with rice and a dip based on vinegar and garlic.`,

Other innards such as kidney and heart are also common additions as well as green peas and bell peppers. Although this pork and liver dish is usually associated with pork menudo due to a few common ingredients, it’s actually closer in taste to adobo and very similar to the Kapampangan kilayin.`,

content: `This is a unique spiced dish made with a variety of seasonings, as well as a couple of vegetables to complement the meat ingredients. It is also pretty popular for its use of pig innards, as I mentioned earlier. But we will go deeper into the components for this dish later on. 

Studies show that Igado was influenced by Spanish cuisine, which you might already be able to tell from its name. “Higado” means liver in Spanish, and some say that Filipinos heard it as “Igado,” hence its name today. `,
},
{
title: `What matches Igado`,
content: `You can choose whatever side dish you like for Igado. But because it’s pretty flavorful and rich, you may want to opt for food with lighter flavor. After all, you don’t want to overpower the already tasty mix of flavors in Igado. This is why the recipe is well-known as a great “ulam” or viand to have with a fresh batch of rice.

It is also pretty common to eat this with drinks as it is a perfect “pulutan” dish! Just like Sisig, this tasty dish helps to offset the rough effect of alcohol, and leaves you reaching for more after every bite. It may not be as famous as the likes of Crispy Pata, but it is definitely something to note for your next drinking session. You can expect a delightfully salty and sour dish to keep you energized as you catch up with friends or family.`,

description: `Igado, a famous Ilocano dish, has long made waves as a uniquely delicious recipe. It’s got a lovely mix of pork liver, pork tenderloin, and bay leaves, among many other spices. After all, part of what makes this recipe so great is its masterful combination of seasonings.

The taste of liver tends to be off-putting to others with its more gummy texture and stronger flavor. But in this dish, it blends perfectly with the savory notes of its seasonings. And it also collaborates well with the refreshing textures of vegetables like bell peppers and carrots. This way, it doesn’t overpower, nor does it shy away from the spotlight as a deliciously salty ingredient.`,

{
title: `How can I make Chicken Igado at home?`,
content: `Start out by pouring 3 tablespoons of oil in a cooking pot, then letting it heat up. Then place 1 lb. of chicken liver inside, and pan-fry this. After 2 minutes of this, carefully turn it to the other side, and fry this as well. As you are cooking, you will notice liquid coming out of the chicken liver.

For this, make sure to let it evaporate fully, and until the liver becomes light brown, just keep the pan-frying going. Repeat the same step until you get your liver completely cooked, but be careful not to overdo it. Overcooked liver can lead to an unpleasant bitter taste. And so once it is perfectly fried and light brown, you can place this on a plate afterwards, and set it aside.

Now we’ll be using the same pan for the next step, but we’ll need to take out the liver residue. For this, wipe the pan down with a paper towel. Now take 3 tablespoons of cooking oil, and heat this in the pan. Add 5 cloves of crushed garlic, and sauté this. When your garlic turns brown, you can place your 1 onion that’s been chopped up inside, and sauté these together.`,
},
{
title: `Let’s incorporate a couple more seasonings, as well as the chicken heart for added flavor!`,
content: `When your onion has softened, you can add your 1 lb of chicken heart that’s been sliced in half. Sauté these ingredients together for 2 minutes. Then incorporate 4 tablespoons of soy sauce, and 5 tablespoons of vinegar into the mix. Cover your pan, and wait for this to boil. Once it starts boiling, cook the mixture for 1 minute. 

Now to infuse your dish with that bit of flavor, we’ll be adding 4 dried bay leaves. Also pour 1 cup of water inside, and then cover the pan. Let this cook for 35 more minutes with low to medium heat, and feel free to pour more water when needed. 

Afterwards, you can take your fried liver from earlier, and place this in the pan. Stir this into the mixture, and then place a cover on top of the pan. For the second to the last step, we’ll be cooking this for 2 minutes. And lastly, sprinkle in some salt and ground black pepper to your taste. Once you’ve transferred this to your place of choice, you can get ready to serve!

And if you’re starting to get confident with your cooking skills, maybe it’s time to try some new things that are quite like this deliciously rich dish! Utilize the delicious and affordable liver ingredient more in your kitchen!`,

It is believed that the dish was derived after the Spanish bistec encebollado. When properly prepared, the flavors should be savory, salty, and tangy. It's important to use only the freshest beef and the most tender cuts such as top round and sirloin.

The dish is traditionally garnished with pan-fried onion rings on top and served with steamed rice on the side.`,

description: `Nilagang baka is a traditional soup originating from the Philippines. Although there are many variations, it's usually prepared with a combination of onions, beef broth, cubed beef, baby bok choy, cabbage, plantains, potatoes, celery, star anise, salt, and pepper.

The soup is simmered until the beef becomes tender and the vegetables are fully cooked. Nilagang baka is especially popular on cold or rainy days, and it's always served hot. Traditionally, it's accompanied by steamed rice and fish sauce (patis). Sometimes, an extra helping of the broth is served in a separate bowl on the side.`,

title: `Where did Nilagang Baka actually come from?`,
content: `Nilagang Baka is a dish that people have been cooking for quite a long time. In fact, it arrived in the Philippines even before the colonial era, as Austronesians introduced the technique of boiling food. And as such, people thought to boil their beef, and integrate a couple of spices. To build the entire meal, they also added vegetables such as potatoes, cabbage and onions, all of which we still use in today’s recipe

But the general beginnings of boiled beef actually had to do with the price of the beef cut. Because the tougher parts of the cow were more affordable, the peasant class from Asia, Europe and America usually utilized this type of meat. They also found that these parts that were bonier created a richer broth, thus leading to dishes like Bulalo, Puchero and of course, Nilagang Baka

This is a dish that we now usually like to serve with some soy sauce or patis for an added saltiness, as well as the always essential cup of rice. Sometimes we also like to squeeze some calamansi on top to make it a bit tangier. But at the end of the day, you can count on Nilagang Baka to be a perfectly delicious standalone dish too.`,

description: `Ube Halaya is a type of Filipino Dessert made from purple yam. There are quite a few ways of preparing this dish. Some Ube halaya version makes use of condensed milk to cook the yam with, while others depend on coconut milk. This version only uses 3 major ingredients: purple yam, coconut milk, and sugar. Although it sounds really simple to prepare (which is true), the outcome is something that you should look forward to.`,
